# SQL Weekend Task Manager

## Description

Duration: 3days

As I continue to advance in my understanding of JavaScript, I wanted to add a database to hold information entered by the user. In this case, the user is myself, and I'm using it to keep track of my extracurricular activities outside of class. In order to complete this I will be creating a database through SQL which connects to a router. This router can then gather stored information on page load, receive new information, provide updates on completed tasks, and delete entries from the database. I will provide a "finished" button that will highlight the task in green signifying completion, as well as a "delete" button if I choose to clear a task. My server will then help direct traffic coming to and from the database, and I will also try and style a simple but elegant user interface. The tools needed to complete this are Postico, Postman, Node modules, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

## Setup

1. npm install
2. npm run server
3. npm run client
4. create a database named weekend-to-do-app
5. use the table in database.sql file, and the default values to get you going

## Usage 

1. Decide on a task you would like to complete
2. Decide on what materials you may need to complete this task
3. Give yourself a time frame in which to complete the task.
4. Click the "Add New Task" button to post that task to the database.
5. If the task is done click the "Finished" button to show that the task is complete
6. To make room for more task or clear ones that are finished press the "Delete" button and the task will 
taken out of the database and be cleared from the DOM.
